## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r table}
table <-c(1,0,3,7,1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
barplot(table, names=c(0.95,2.95,4.95,6.95,8.95), col=rgb(0.20,0.40,0.80,1), xlab="Amount of Arsenic (micrograms/serving)", ylab="Frequency", main="Arsenic in Rice", ylim=c(0,8), width=c(1,1,1,1,1), space=c(0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
